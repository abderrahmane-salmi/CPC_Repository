# Competitive Programming and Contests - Hands-On Repository

This repository contains the solutions and implementations of the hands-on exercises for the **Competitive Programming and Contests** course at the University of Pisa, offered in the academic year **2024-25**. The course covers essential algorithms and data structures, helping students build practical skills in competitive programming.

The hands-on exercises cover a range of topics, including binary trees, segment trees, and dynamic programming, all implemented in Rust.

## Hands-On Overview

### Hands-On 1: Recursive Traversals of a Binary Tree
- **Date:** October 4, 2024
- **Objective:** Implement recursive traversals of a binary tree in Rust.
- **Key Topics:** Binary trees, recursive algorithms, depth-first search (DFS).
- **Description:** This hands-on assignment focuses on understanding and implementing recursive tree traversal techniques. These exercises are essential for coding interviews and building a deeper understanding of binary trees.

### Hands-On 2: Segment Trees
- **Date:** November 7, 2024
- **Objective:** Implement and solve problems using Segment Trees in Rust.
- **Key Topics:** Segment trees, range queries, range updates.
- **Description:** In this hands-on, we focus on learning how to efficiently solve problems using segment trees, a powerful data structure used for range queries and updates. There are two problems to solve related to segment trees.
